# novel-comment-analysis


## scraper
Set up a scraper on Wuxiaworld.com to grab Chapter, Publication Date, and Comments for 6 online novels throughout multiple years and thousands of chapters. <br>
Used BeautifulSoup 4 to scrape Chapter and Publication date. <br>
Used Selenium to run a driver and load user comments (javascript elements). <br>

## clean data
Formatted data into csv files (one for each novel). <br>
Cleaned data.

## analysis
Set up three plots for each novel, plotting all variables with one another to find trends. <br>
Found that after long hiatuses, sometimes authors/translators released multiple chapters at once to make up for lost time. 
This strategy actually results in lower reader engagement than on average. <br>
Hypothesis as to why: readers are binge reading, and are less likely to comment/engage if there is another chapter to read instead.

## notes
refer to final-project-analysis-project-EVERYTHING for a full Jupyter notebook complete with conclusions and graphs.
